                <p class="lead">Let me tell you a story about the day I almost threw in the towel on my own hip. I was warming up for half an hour just to start work, pulling my hamstring, then my groin, couldn't skate anymore... and I was playing in three hockey leagues. The cycle was killing me.</p>

                <h2>The Day Everything Changed</h2>
                
                <p>So here I am, a chiropractor who's supposed to be helping people, and I can barely help myself. I had this patient who said, "I've got the guy for you." She gave me his number and I saved him in my phone as "Miracle Dry Needling Man" because that's literally what she called him.</p>

                <p>Now, I'm thinking, "Ben, I'm a chiropractor. You're a chiropractor. You're supposed to be the best. You have the Cleveland Browns and Chicago Blackhawks flying into town to see you. How good are you? Let's do this thing."</p>

                <p>And then he pulled out these needles. I'm talking needles that looked like this—way bigger than anything I'd ever used. He said the same thing I tell my patients now: "I don't know what's wrong with you. We need to figure it out. It might take four treatments, might take nine, might take one. I don't know."</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h3>The Reality Check</h3>
                    <p>Here's what nobody tells you about real healing: sometimes it gets uncomfortable before it gets better. I was hanging on, sweating, and when he hit my sciatic nerve, my foot went numb. But you know what? That discomfort led to the solution.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Why I'm Not Your TikTok Chiropractor</h2>

                <p>People come in asking, "Is it like the one where they pull on your head with a towel?" Listen, I'm not a TikTok chiropractor. I'm not an Instagram chiropractor. I'm not going to jerk you off the table and jump around yelling "that's crispy."</p>

                <p>I'm an old, stodgy person who believes in doing things right. When someone asks if I'm going to hurt them, I'm honest: "With dry needling, it's not going to feel like butterflies and rainbows. It's definitely a different sensation." But here's the thing—I'm not doing it if it's not worth doing.</p>

                <h3>What Really Happened That Day</h3>

                <p>Back to my hip story. This guy Ben worked on everything—needles in my groin (hitting the pectineus), my psoas, all my hamstrings, my quads, then through my glutes. He was targeting this muscle about that long attached to my femoral head. That's when he hit the sciatic nerve running right through there.</p>

                <p>He said, "I'm going to get one of these, and it's probably going to be this one." It was called the gemellus—part of what they call the deep six muscles. He stuck the needle in there, and you know what? My hip hasn't hurt me since. That was the last treatment.</p>

                <h2>The Learning Never Stops</h2>

                <p>That experience changed everything for me. I went from doing superficial dry needling with Dr. Fong—just short needles in the trapezius, staying away from the lungs—to learning this powerful, deep technique. What they're teaching now is way different. Way different. Way different.</p>

                <p>I remember thinking, "I could see this being all I do." My friend Ben, the guy who treated my hip? That's actually all he did—dry needle. He adjusted me once out of nine visits. Once! And here I was, almost considering an orthopedic consult for a hip replacement because the pain was keeping me up at night.</p>

                <h3>The Honest Truth About Treatment</h3>

                <p>Here's what I tell people now: "I will move it any way that makes you comfortable with having it moved." I've got five different ways to move something right here in this office. Manual adjustments, activator tools, drop table where the table drops down, instrument-assisted methods—whatever works for you.</p>

                <p>Because here's the thing—I'm a little bit of a mechanic. It hurts here, I'm going to treat there. That's Medicine 101 thinking, right? But with dry needling, I'm learning to think differently. If you have a calf issue, I might work up here in the spine because that's the nerve that feeds this area. I'm actually retraining your brain to make everything work properly.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h3>Pain Is All In Your Head (But Not How You Think)</h3>
                    <p>Look, all pain is neurological. It's your brain that perceives information at a level that creates pain. People with fibromyalgia? That's a central nervous system pain disorder. We used to think those people were crazy—called it "UFO-myalgia." But lack of sleep feeds into depression, muscles don't get the rest they need... it's all connected.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>The Cool Toys That Actually Work</h2>

                <p>Okay, let me tell you about some of the equipment I use. I'm a big believer in PEMF—pulsed electromagnetic frequency therapy. I put that thing on my ribs when I injured my cartilage, and this cartilage that should take six to eight weeks to heal? I was basically pain-free in days.</p>

                <p>The little PEMF units I have are great because you can use them all day, every day. You can put one on your knee if you want—I'll give you one to take home and try it. It's just a battery pack that goes into USB, and it runs for an hour unless you shut it off. You just sit there with it on for three, four hours at a time, and it stimulates healing.</p>

                <h3>Shockwave Therapy: Not Your Average Treatment</h3>

                <p>Now, shockwave therapy—that's interesting stuff. Someone asked me, "How do I market it? What do I treat with shockwave?" Well, I treat knees, plantar fasciitis, rotator cuff issues, golfer's elbow, tennis elbow, carpal tunnel, peripheral neuropathy...</p>

                <p>Here's what it does: it stimulates the cells themselves to actually regrow, to rebuild. It's a physical stimulus because it's a sound wave, and you feel the shock of that happening. It's different from PEMF, which is electromagnetic frequency that opens up capillaries to increase blood flow.</p>

                <p>The unit I'm getting is $800 from China. If it goes down, I buy another one. Those $20,000 machines in the States? If they go down, you want someone to fix it. Me? I'd rather just replace it and keep treating people.</p>

                <h2>Why I Do What I Do</h2>

                <p>Look, I haven't done enough dry needling yet to be the person who has all the answers. When I'm working across someone's chest, I have to worry about lungs. That's something we talk about with patients, but I can't give you the same confidence level I have with adjustments—yet. I can academically address everything, but the practical experience? That's still building.</p>

                <p>But here's what I can tell you: I was almost disabled with my hip. Debilitating pain that was keeping me up at night. I was actually considering an orthopedic consult—me, a chiropractor, thinking about hip replacement surgery. One treatment with the right technique, hitting the right spot, and I haven't been back to see Ben for anything since.</p>

                <h3>The Diagnostic Detective Work</h3>

                <p>Going to that dry needling course, they talked about using it as a diagnostic tool. When somebody has pain, it's often because of something in another location. That's the direction we're going—you have pain in this spot, but if I can get the quad and hamstring to release, it's going to give you more pliability here.</p>

                <p>This is a change in thinking for me. I'm used to being a mechanic—it hurts here, I treat here. But now I'm learning: if you have a calf issue, I'm going to work here too, because that's the nerve that feeds this area. I'm going to stimulate the nerve and work on the muscle. It's like retraining your brain.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h3>The Real Talk About Getting Better</h3>
                    <p>When people ask if I'm going to hurt them, I'm honest. With dry needling, some spots are going to be uncomfortable. But I wouldn't do it if it wasn't worth doing. And here's the thing about fear—if you're afraid of needles, I can't do it. Your skin won't allow it. We need to talk through it first.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Building Relationships Beyond Treatment</h2>

                <p>You know what I love about this work? It's not just about the techniques. When I'm not in the office, you'll find me hiking with my family or out fishing—those quiet moments help me think through complex cases. And teaching anatomy and physiology keeps me sharp on the fundamentals. You can't treat what you don't truly understand at the cellular level.</p>

                <p>When I offer to treat gym owners or martial arts instructors for free a couple times, it's not just marketing. It's because I want them to know I'm not some crazy person. I want them to know I'm okay at this, and then maybe they'll send me their people who really need help.</p>
