                        Chiropractic care is a healthcare discipline that focuses on diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal disorders, particularly those affecting the spine. Through manual adjustments and manipulations, chiropractors restore proper alignment, reduce pain, improve mobility, and support your body's natural healing process.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Chiropractic care is highly effective for back pain, neck pain, headaches, migraines, sciatica, sports injuries, auto accident injuries, joint pain, and many musculoskeletal conditions. We focus on treating the root cause, not just masking symptoms.

                        Is chiropractic care safe?

                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Yes, chiropractic care is extremely safe when performed by a licensed professional like Dr. Andrew Allen. Serious complications are very rare. Most patients experience immediate relief and improved mobility with minimal to no discomfort during treatment.

                        Are chiropractic adjustments painful?

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Most adjustments are not painful. You may hear a popping or cracking sound during an adjustment, which is simply gas being released from the joints—similar to cracking your knuckles. Many patients describe immediate relief and a feeling of lightness after treatment. We tailor every adjustment to your comfort level.

                        Every patient is different. Some experience relief after 1-2 sessions, while others with chronic conditions may need ongoing care. During your initial evaluation, we'll give you a clear, honest timeline based on your specific condition—no guesswork or endless appointments. Our goal is to get you better, not to keep you coming back forever.

                        Your first visit includes a comprehensive 30-minute evaluation where we'll review your health history, discuss your symptoms and goals, perform a physical assessment, and create a personalized treatment plan. If appropriate, we may begin treatment during your first visit. You'll leave with a clear understanding of your condition and the path forward.

                        Initial evaluations are 30 minutes to ensure we have time to fully understand your condition. Follow-up treatment sessions typically range from 15-30 minutes depending on your personalized care plan. We never rush—you get the time you need.

                        Dry needling is a therapeutic technique that uses thin needles to target trigger points and muscle tension. It's highly effective for chronic pain, muscle knots, sports injuries, and accelerating recovery. The needles stimulate the body's natural healing response, releasing tension and improving blood flow to the affected area.
